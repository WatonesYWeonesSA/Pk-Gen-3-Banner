ADDITIONAL CONDITION FOR MONETIZED GAMEPLAY CONTENT

1. Definitions

For the purposes of this License:

(a) "Gameplay Content" means any audiovisual content (including but not limited
to livestreams, VODs, clips, shorts or edited videos) that shows or makes use
of the Software or any derivative work of the Software in the context of
playing, displaying or interacting with a video game.

(b) "Monetized Gameplay Content" means Gameplay Content that directly or
indirectly generates revenue for the creator, including but not limited to
platform monetization (ads, memberships, subscriptions), sponsorships,
donations, or any other form of commercial exploitation associated with the
content.

2. Attribution Requirement

Any Monetized Gameplay Content that uses, displays or otherwise benefits from
the Software or any derivative work of the Software MUST include an on-screen
credit during the video itself, clearly visible to viewers, crediting

A compliant attribution includes, for example (non-exhaustive):

- "Powered by watones y weones S.A."

The attribution must appear within the audiovisual footage (not only in the

non-trivial portion of the content (for example, as a persistent watermark or
as a clearly visible card at the beginning or end of the video).

right to enforce its rights, including but not limited to:

- issuing copyright takedown notices (including DMCA or equivalent notices)
  to the relevant platform(s), and/or
- requesting removal or blocking of the infringing content, and/or

  infringing content to the extent permitted by the platform’s policies and
  applicable law.
